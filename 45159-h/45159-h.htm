<p>The object of the Editors of this series is a very definite one.
They desire above all things that, in their humble way, these books
shall be the ambassadors of good-will and understanding between East
and West&mdash;the old world of Thought and the new of Action. In this
endeavour, and in their own sphere, they are but followers of the
highest example in the land. They are confident that a deeper knowledge
of the great ideals and lofty philosophy of Oriental thought may help
to a revival of that true spirit of Charity which neither despises nor
fears the nation of another creed and colour.</p>

<h4><a name="I_THE_ORIGIN_OF_SUFIISM" id="I_THE_ORIGIN_OF_SUFIISM">I. THE ORIGIN OF SÚFÍISM</a></h4>


<p>Among the Mohammedans Súfíism, or Persian mysticism, is known as
<i>tasawwuf</i>. The word Sidi is derived from <i>súf</i>, meaning "wool." When
a little Persian sect at the end of the eighth century <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">A.D.</span> broke away
from the orthodox Muslim religion, and struck out on an independent
path, they ignored costly robes and worldly ostentation, and clad
themselves in a white wool garment. Hence they were known as "wool
wearers," or Súfís.</p>

<p>Prof. Edward G. Browne<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> gives four theories in regard to the origin
of Súfíism, viz.: (1) <i>Esoteric Doctrine of the Prophet</i>.(2) <i>Reaction
of the Aryan mind against a Semitic religion</i>. (3) <i>Neo-Platonist
influence</i>.(4) <i>Independent origin</i>. Neither of the four theories
altogether satisfies the learned professor, and very certain it is
that the last-mentioned theory is of very little account. Prof. Browne
seems in favour of a "spontaneous growth" existing in various forms,
under various names throughout the civilised world; but after all
this is not very tangible evidence. Moreover, we must bear in mind
that the Neo-Platonist philosophers paid a visit to the Persian court
in the sixth century <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">A.D.</span>, and founded a school there in the reign
of Núshír-wan. It is highly probable, therefore, that these seven
philosophers, forced to leave their homes through the tyranny of
Justinian, who forbade the teaching of philosophy at Athens, should
have had considerable influence upon a few of the more thoughtful
Persians. We shall now find that this theory is borne out by internal
evidence.</p>

<p>Let us briefly study the tenets of Neo-Platonism. The Neo-Platonists
believed in the Supreme Good as the Source of all things.
Self-existent, it generated from itself. Creation was the reflection of
its own Being. Nature, therefore, was permeated with God. Matter was
essentially non-existent, a temporary and ever-moving shadow for the
embodiment of the Divine. The Neo-Platonists believed that by ecstasy
and contemplation of the All-Good, man would rise to that Source from
whence he came. These points bear directly upon the Súfí teaching.
They form a broad outline of the tenets of Súfíism. The Súfís, from
temperamental and other causes, elaborated these ideas, gave them a
rich and beautiful setting, and, what is all-important, built about
them one of the most interesting phases of mystical poetry the world
has ever known, and this particular phase may be said to date from the
twelfth century <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">A.D.</span></p>

<p>Thus, I think, it will be readily admitted that the Súfís certainly
owed something to the Neo-Platonists. The cry for the Beloved was in
their hearts before the Greek philosophers came; but Neo-Platonism
appealed to their Oriental minds. It was a stepping-stone across
the river of their particular spiritual tendencies, and they trod
thereon, and proceeded to lay down other stones across the stream. I
have pointed out the similarities between this particular Greek and
Persian belief. There was, however, one very important difference.
The Neo-Platonist's conception of God was purely abstract, the Súfí's
essentially personal, as far as the early Súfís were concerned. We
shall consider other influences which were brought to bear upon Súfíism
a little later on. There is a very great difference between the early
Súfíism and the elaborate additions that followed as an evolutionary
matter of course.</p>

<p>In brief, then, Neo-Platonism was the doctrine of Ecstasy. A quotation
from the letter of Plotinus to Flaccus on Ecstasy will still further
show the similarities between this Greek and Persian teaching:</p>

<p>"The wise man recognises the idea of the Good within him. This he
develops by withdrawal into the Holy Place of his own soul. He who does
not understand how the soul contains the Beautiful within itself, seeks
to realise beauty without, by laborious production. His aim should
rather be to concentrate and simplify, and so to expand his being;
instead of going out into the Manifold, to forsake it for the One, and
so to float upwards towards the Divine Fount of Being whose stream
flows within him."</p>

<p>This is Súfíism in prose. The Súfí turned the same conception into
<i>poetry</i>.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h4><a name="II_THE_EARLY_SUFIS" id="II_THE_EARLY_SUFIS">II. THE EARLY SÚFÍS.</a></h4>


<p>Abú Hashím (ob. 150 <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">A.H.</span>) was the first to bear the name of Súfí,
while Dhu'l-Nún-al-Misri (245 <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">A.H.</span>) may be said to have given Súfíism
its permanent shape. Rābi'a, of Basra, was the first woman to join
the sect, and her saintliness and wise sayings have been preserved by
Farídu'd-Dín 'Attár. One day a great sickness fell upon Rabi'a, and on
being asked the reason for it she replied: "I dwelt upon the joys of
Paradise and therefore my Beloved has chastened me."</p>

<p>Rābi'a did not believe in earthly marriage. Her remark on the subject
is given as follows: "The bonds of wedlock have descended upon me. I am
not my own, but my Lord's, and must not be unfaithful to Him." 'Attár
also informs us that when Rābi'a was asked if she hated the devil, she
replied: "My love to God leaves me no time to hate him." Rābi'a was a
woman of much independence of thought, ethical rather than metaphysical
in her remarks, and strongly opposed to outward ceremonials. She is
said to have died at Jerusalem, 753 <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">A.D.</span> It was at Ramla, in Palestine,
that a Christian nobleman built a convent (<i>Khāngāh</i>) for the Súfís.
Thus in the early days the sect defied their Prophet's condemnation of
monkery by building an abode for members of the order. The Súfís were
strongly opposed to the idea of free-will or distinct and self-existent
personality apart from the Beloved. The orthodox Muslim's idea was
precisely the reverse. The Súfís have always made the Koran their
text-book. With infinite licence they ingeniously quote therefrom,
and still more ingeniously add their own explanations when necessary.
No doubt there were political reasons for adopting this method of
concealing heterodox ideas under the cloak of orthodoxy. We shall see,
however, as the sect grew and still further broadened its views, that
these clever compromises did not prevent the appearance of martyrs
among their number in the future.</p>

<p>By the end of the second century of the Hijira the Súfís were a
much-respected religious order. In the following century Quietism had
not only changed to Pantheism, but Pantheism had kindled a belief that
Beloved and lover were identical. The step was inevitable and at this
juncture it was that Súfíism became essentially mystical, and it became
more mystical as years advanced. About this time, viz., the beginning
of the third century <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">A.H.</span>, we come across two interesting Súfís who
seem to have been the prime movers in this new development, by name
Bayázíd and Mansur al-Halláj.</p>

<p>Concerning the saint Bayázíd an interesting story is told in the
Fourth Book of the <i>Masnavi</i>. The saint surprised his disciples one
day by saying: "Lo, I myself am God Almighty. There is no God beside
me; worship me!" The disciples, thinking their Master was beside
himself, told him, when the strange ecstasy had passed, what he had
said. Bayázíd promptly replied: "If I do so again straightway slay
me!" His disciples accordingly sharpened their knives. Once more
Bayázíd cried out: "Within my vesture is naught but God, whether you
seek Him on earth or heaven." The disciples, horror-struck at his
remarks, straightway plunged their knives into Bayázíd's body. But
their blades were turned back against their own throats, so that
they died. He explained to the few disciples, who had not struck him,
that the ecstasy he had been experiencing annihilated self, "His form
is vanished, he is a mere mirror." The disciples who had struck him
saw their own faces in that mirror and so wounded themselves, and not
Bayázíd, whose soul had left the mirror of his body and was one with
the Beloved.</p>

<p>Perhaps the life of Mansur al-Halláj is even more interesting. Whether
he was a mere adventurer or genuine exponent of Súfíism is still
open to controversy among modern Súfís. It will be perfectly safe to
describe him as either a saint or a vagabond. He was possibly both
extremes to suit the necessities of a very exciting and eventful
career. He was born in the close of the ninth century <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">A.D.</span>, and was
said to perform many miracles, such as raising the dead to life, and
drawing gold and flowers from the air. According to his own belief he
could write verses equal to those of the Koran. He went one better
than the "superman" theory, however, and called himself God, and
his disciples after the various prophets. Akbar was called God, but
deification in this case did not sound from his own trumpet; it sounded
from the trumpet of an enthusiastic poet: "See Akbar and you see God."
Al-Halláj visited India for the purpose of studying magic, and there
saw the celebrated Rope Trick, on that occasion performed by a woman,
a point of considerable interest.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This mystic-adventurer wrote
forty-six books, and certainly gained considerable influence over
the lower classes by his many signs and wonders. He is said to have
disputed the necessity of making a pilgrimage to Mecca by stating that
by occult practices it could be performed equally well in any room. On
a certain occasion, however, we cannot help but admire Al-Halláj's wit
and aptitude. One day he stretched forth an empty hand and produced
from the air an apple, which he asserted he had plucked from Paradise.
One of his witnesses disputed his assertion, because this particular
apple was maggot-eaten, and therefore not of Divine origin. Al-Halláj
at once replied: "It is because it bath come forth from the Mansion of
Eternity to the Abode of Decay: therefore to its heart hath corruption
found its way!"</p>

<p>Al-Halláj, on account of his various heretical teachings, was
imprisoned and subjected to all manner of cruelties. Bravely he went
forth to the place of crucifixion. For four days he was nailed on a
cross on both sides of the Tigris. From these tortures he was finally
released. Ten years later he was executed, telling his disciples he
would return to them in thirty days, and exultantly reciting poetry,
he cried: "From His own cup He bade me sup, for such is hospitality!"
A comment of his on Súfíism&mdash;a very ironical one&mdash;was: "That which is
mine, for by God I never distinguished for a moment between pleasure
and pain!" Yet another characteristic saying of his was: "The way
to God is two steps: one step out of this world and one step out of
the next world, and lo! you are there with the Lord!" Whatever were
the faults of Al-Halláj, and they were many, at least it may be said
of him that he was a brave man. With all his fanaticism, his absurd
indiscretion and love of conjuring, he left much behind of permanent
value to the Súfís. The Government, in those days, did all in its power
to restrain the publicity of his books; but a light that was never
for a moment set under a bushel cannot be hid; the very attempt to
obliterate it is in itself the cause for a keener and more persistent
search.</p>

<p>In the fifth century of the Hijira we may note Abu-l-Khair as the first
to give Súfíism politic significance, and Imān Ghazālī as the first to
give it a metaphysical basis. At this time we find in Súfí books many
terms borrowed from the Neo-Platonists. Books on ethics, as well as
poetry, now became impregnated with Súfí ideas.</p>

<p>In the Islám faith there are eight Paradises arranged one within the
other in ascending stages. The highest is called "The Garden of Eden."
All are lovely gardens full of luxuriant flowers and trees, amid which
gleam the domes and minarets of gorgeous palaces, rich with precious
stones, where the departed are feasted and entertained by beautiful
<i>houris</i>. All the Paradises are watered by rivers, such as the Kevser,
the Tesním, and the Selsebíl. The great Tūba tree grows in the highest
Paradise; its branches fall into the seven other gardens.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> This brief
description will be sufficient to show the nature of the Muslim heaven.
That it was a glorified creation of the earth in eight degrees is
evident. It was sensuous rather than metaphysical. The five worlds of
the Súfís are:</p>

<p class="poet">
1. The "Plane of the Absolute Invisible."<br />
2. The "Relatively Invisible."<br />
3. The "World of Similitudes."<br />
4. The "Visible World" (or the plane of "Form, Generation and Corruption").<br />
5. The "World of Man."<br />
</p>

<p>These Five Planes are often regarded as Three: the "Invisible," the
"Intermediate," and the "Visible," or yet again as simply the "Visible"
and "Invisible." Above the "Plane of the Absolute Invisible" is an
infinity which we might, perhaps, compare with Dante's "Spaceless
Empyrean." The Súfís regarded the existence of the soul as pre-natal.
Moreover that the full perception of Earthly Beauty was the remembrance
of that Supreme Beauty in the Spiritual world. The body was the veil;
but by ecstasy (<i>Hál</i>) the soul could behold the Divine Mysteries. As
Avicenna, in his poem on the soul, has written:</p>

<p class="poet">
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Lo, it was hurled</span><br />
Midst the sign-posts and ruined abodes of this desolate world.<br />
It weeps, when it thinks of its home and the peace it possessed,<br />
With tears welling forth from its eyes without pausing or rest,<br />
And with plaintive mourning it broodeth like one bereft<br />
O'er such trace of its home as the fourfold winds have left.<br />
</p>

<p>Creation was regarded as the output of the All-Beautiful. The visible
world and all therein was a reflection of the Divine, an ever-changing
scene full of the Spirit of God. The following beautiful poem of Jámí,
from <i>Yúsuf-u-Zulaykhá</i>, will illustrate the Súfí's conception of the
Beloved and His significance and relationship to His world of lovers:</p>

<p class="poet">
No mirror to reflect Its loveliness,<br />
Nor comb to touch Its locks; the morning breeze<br />
Ne'er stirred Its tresses; no collyrium<br />
Lent lustre to Its eyes; no rosy cheeks<br />
O'ershadowed by dark curls like hyacinth,<br />
Nor peach-like down were there....<br />
To Itself it sang of love<br />
In wordless measure. By Itself it cast<br />
The die of love....<br />
One gleam fell from It on the Universe<br />
And on the angels, and this single ray<br />
Dazzled the angels, till their senses whirled<br />
Like the revolving sky. In diverse forms<br />
Each mirror showed it forth, and everywhere<br />
Its praise was chanted in new harmonies.<br />
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br />
The spirits who explore the depths<br />
Of boundless seas, wherein the heavens swim<br />
Like some small boat, cried with one mighty voice,<br />
"Praise to the Lord of all the universe!"<br />
His beauty everywhere doth show itself,<br />
And through the forms of earthly beauties shines<br />
Obscured as through a veil....<br />
Where'er thou seest a veil,<br />
Beneath that veil He hides. Whatever heart<br />
Doth yield to love, He charms it. In His love<br />
The heart hath life. Longing for Him, the soul<br />
Hath victory.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><br />
</p>

<p>Man was, therefore, a part of God, because he was a fragment of the
Whole; or, better still, he was a divine emanation.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The Súfí
recognised this fact, and his supreme desire was to be reunited
with the Beloved. His difficulty, however, was to bear in mind that
his worship should ever be of God, and not of God's many beautiful
forms. Love came into his heart, and he endeavoured to recognise that
earthly objects, however dear and beautiful they might be, were but
lanterns where God's Light shone through. Here it must be readily
admitted that Súfíism often fails. The Súfí poets were much given to
excessive laudations of physical beauty, and we often find, with all
the toleration and ingenuity we can bring to bear, that some of Háfiz's
lines are no more spiritual than Anacreon's, to whom he has been
compared. We have a number of Súfí words with a strictly Súfí meaning;
but it would not be wise to strain the analogy of earthly love too far
and say that everything that Háfiz wrote was spiritual. The Súfí poets,
for the most part, wrote about the Love of God in the terms applied
to their beautiful women, for the simple reason that no one can write
the celestial language and be understood at the same time. Is it to be
wondered at that the Súfís, still remembering their old love-songs,
their old earthly delights in women dear to them, should find it
difficult <i>not</i> to apply such names, such ideas even in their love of
the One Beloved? Take those expressions literally and many of them
are sensuous, but consider them as brave, strong strivings, fraught
with much spiritual fervour, after God, and you at once annihilate
prejudice and come very near understanding the meaning of Súfíism. We
need not fly to Mrs. Grundy and seek shelter under her hypocritical
wing when some really devout and sincere Súfí calls God "the Eternal
Darling" or sings about the Beloved's curls. In studying Súfíism from
Súfí poetry we must always remember that Eastern poetry is essentially
erotic in expression, but just as essentially symbolic in <i>meaning</i>.
We must also bear in mind&mdash;and this point must have had its influence
upon Súfíism&mdash;that the Muslim's reward for having lived a good life,
according to the teaching of Mohammed, was that he should enjoy an
eternal <i>liaison</i> with lovely <i>houris</i>.</p>

<p>It may be questioned that if the earthly object of Love was a mere
passing shadow of God, the man who loved that object was equally
insignificant. And again, how can God be the All-One when, according
to the Súfí thesis, He divided Himself into creation? The part is not
equal to the whole. These questions are easily answered. The stars
shine in the sky, and on the bosom of the sea without diminution.
Let the sea pass away, and the star-shadows pass away too; but the
stars are still there. So when the world shall pass away it will only
be the fading of innumerable shadows we call Humanity. God will still
be there, and we shall still be there because we came alone from Him.
There was a Voice that sounded in men and women, in mountains and in
seas, in the beasts of the jungle and the swinging of the stars. It was
the Voice of Love, the great beckoning in the Hereafter to which all
things must go. That Voice to the Súfí was God calling His lovers into
one chamber, one mighty love-feast. Jámí has expressed the finality of
Love in the following lines:</p>

<p class="poet">
Gaze, till Gazing out of Gazing<br />
Grew to <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">BEING</span> Her I gaze on,<br />
She and I no more, but in One<br />
Undivided Being blended.<br />
All that is not One must ever<br />
Suffer with the Wound of Absence;<br />
And whoever in Love's City<br />
Enters, finds but Room for One,<br />
And but in <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ONENESS</span> Union.<br />
</p>

<p>The Rev. Professor W. R. Inge, in <i>Christian Mysticism</i>, has brought a
good deal of adverse criticism to bear upon Súfíism. He remarks: "The
Súfís, or Mohammedan Mystics, use erotic language very freely, and
appear, like true Asiatics, to have attempted to give a sacramental
or symbolic character to the indulgence of their passions." The same
writer accuses Emerson of "playing with pantheistic Mysticism of the
Oriental type," and goes on to compare him with the Persian Súfís on
account of his self-deification. This critic, in his desire to defame
the Súfís, states that they are among the most shocking and blasphemous
of the mystics, because they believe that state is present with them
even in their earthly life. This, however, is no teaching of the
Súfís, and, rightly considered, we cannot even except the sayings of
Bayázíd already referred to, because here he undoubtedly denies all
claim to human personality, admitting God only. <i>Self</i>-deification is
no teaching of the Súfís. As the Buddhist's belief in Nirvana was a
state only to be reached by degrees, after much striving and severe
discipline, so was the fusion of the Beloved and His lover a belief
and a beautiful hope far out on the spiritual horizon. Hadj Khan, in
his interesting book <i>With the Pilgrims to Mecca</i>, briefly touches
upon this sect and mentions "seven stages" in the spiritual growth
of the Súfí, and not an arrogant proclamation of Deity and man being
coequal in the earthly existence. The gradually ascending scale of
the Súfí's heaven is another point in favour of this argument. "For
the love that thou would'st find demands the sacrifice of self to the
end that the heart may be filled with the passion to stand within
the Holy of Holies, in which alone the mysteries of the True Beloved
can be revealed unto thee." The average Súfí was a poet. All that was
beautiful was God to him. He tried to be nearer the Beautiful every
day, and thus his soul swept on from flower to flower, higher and
higher, until he was absorbed into the Divine.</p>

<p>We have now seen that Súfíism is essentially a religion of Love without
a creed or dogma. No merciless hells leap up in the Súfí's beliefs.
He has no <i>one way</i> theory for the Life beyond: "The ways of God are
as the number of the souls of men." There is splendid, magnificent
broad-mindedness in this Súfí remark. This unsectarian teaching should
be applied to every religion. It would tend to sweeten and deepen the
thoughts of men, who would forget the petty non-essentials of creeds
and dogmas, lost in the perception of the All-Beautiful.</p>

<p>Although Jalálu'd-Dín Rúmí lived for fifty years in a Turkish city he
scarcely ever used any Turkish words; but nevertheless his influence on
Turkish poetry was very considerable. The Turkish poets of that day
poured forth innumerable "spiritual couplets" of a mystical nature.
Indeed nearly all the Ottoman poets were either Súfís or men who wrote
after the manner of the Persian Súfís. Jalál's son, Sultan Valad, wrote
in Turkish the following concerning his father:</p>

<p class="poet">
Wot ye well Mevláná is of saints the Pole;<br />
Whatsoever thing he sayeth, do in whole.<br />
All his words are mercies from the Heavenly King;<br />
Such that blind folks' eyes were opened, did they sing.<br />
</p>

<p>The Súfí influence on Turkish poetry, many years after Jalál's death,
gradually weakened as time went on, and their poetry became less
mystical. The French were probably responsible for this change to a
certain extent.</p>

<p>Then, again, Súfíism influenced the poetry of India; but in this case
there was influence on both sides, and the Súfís probably borrowed some
of the Buddhistic ideas, especially in regard to their later conception
of Divine absorption. The following remark of Abú Bahu al-Shiblí
certainly points to the belief that the Súfís inculcated certain ideas
from the Vedanta Philosophy:&mdash;"<i>Tasawwuf</i> is control of the faculties
and <i>observance of the breaths.</i>"</p>

<p>Súfí poetry has greatly influenced Western thought. Many of the German
mystics wrote as the Súfí poets had written before them. Particularly
might be mentioned Eckhart, Tauler and Suso. Concerning the last
mentioned I may quote the following passage to demonstrate my meaning:
"Earthly friends must needs endure to be distinct and separate from
those whom they love; but Thou, O fathomless sweetness of all true
love, meltest into the heart of Thy beloved, and pourest Thyself fully
into the essence of his soul, that nothing of Thee remains outside, but
Thou art joined and united most lovingly with Thy beloved." There was
rapturous language both with the Persian and German mystics. The great
difference between them was that the German mystics, for the most part,
were ascetics, the Persians were not. Then again in the nineteenth
century Hegel was loud in his praise of Jalálu'd-Dín Rúmí, calling him
a great thinker as well as a great poet, but somehow he seems to put
Jalál's Pantheism first, his Mysticism second. Surely this was putting
the cart before the horse?</p>

<p>To trace the scope of the influence of Súfí thought in England would
be extremely interesting, but the limits of this little book will
not admit of our doing so. The influence was at first among the few;
but optimistic lovers of the East believe that Oriental thought is
daily becoming of more interest to Western minds. The student knows
that Edward FitzGerald's rendering of Omar Khayyám, was anything but
a faithful translation; that FitzGerald shook up Omar's words like
so many dice and set them to the music of wine, roses, and pessimism.
The Omar Khayyám Club read FitzGerald, but not Omar Khayyám, and in
consequence they have fallen into the error of associating Omar with
Bacchus. But, nevertheless, we must be grateful to FitzGerald. He has
given us a great poem, and stirred, let us hope, many of his countless
readers to a more faithful study of Persian poetry. The indefatigable
Dr. Johnson has written the following on the Persian poet, who is the
subject of our present volume: "He makes plain to the Pilgrim the
secrets of the Way of Unity, and unveils the Mysteries of the Path of
Eternal Truth." Concerning our modern poets I have quoted elsewhere
a few lines of Mr. Arthur Symons on a dancing dervish. Many of the
late Thomas Lake Harris's poems are of a Súfí nature. In Mr. Stephen
Phillip's beautiful poem "Marpessa," the following lines are full of
Sidi mysticism:</p>

<p class="poet">
<span style="margin-left: 40%;">For they,</span><br />
Seeking that perfect face beyond the world,<br />
Approach in vision earthly semblances,<br />
And touch, and at the shadows flee away.<br />
</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that at least one celebrated Englishman
adopted the Súfí teaching. I refer to Sir Richard Burton.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The Súfís
believed heart and soul in the beautiful lines of Cameons, the poet
for whom Burton had so great an affection:</p>

<p>
Do what thy manhood bids thee do, from none but self expect applause.<br />
He noblest lives and noblest dies who makes and keeps his self-made laws.<br />
All other life is living death, a world where none but phantoms dwell;<br />
A breath, a wind, a sound, a voice, a tinkling of the camel-bell.<br />

<p>Súfíism, then, is the religion of Love. Lafcadio Hearn tells us, in his
inimitable way, that earthly love is brought about by the memories of
innumerable loves in the past, a host of the phantoms of you seeking
in your momentary ego the joy of Love over again. Schopenhauer, with
much pride, quotes Rochefoucauld as having said that "love may be
compared to a ghost since it is something we talk about but have
never seen." Precisely; but this is no antagonistic statement, as
Schopenhauer supposed. Rather than belittling the beauty of Love,
it is an unconscious defence of a very great truth. Love can only
be compared with Love. There is nothing else to compare it with. No
one has seen Love, because no one has seen God. A little child plays
at funerals and tenderly buries a dead butterfly, not because it
understands the mystery of Death, but because Love prompted the action.
And so we love without knowing the why and the wherefore. Scientists
have already proved that first love is not controlled by either of
the individuals loving; that it is but the expression of thousands
of tendencies in past lives. That Love can be ever personal, ever
limited to the individual, is unthinkable. We must recognise some day
that those countless tendencies, those strivings after men and women
seeming to hold our souls' affinities, were but the momentary finding
of God in His creatures. We do not love a woman merely because she is
pretty, possesses a pleasing mannerism. We love her because, in an
indescribable way, she sings a song we alone can fully understand,
a voice that lifts up our soul and makes it strong. We follow that
Invisible Figure from land to land, from heart to heart, from Death
into Life, on and on. When Love loves Love for its own sake, when the
self is dead, we shall meet Him. We shall find the Beloved to be the
Perfection, the realisation of that strong desire that made us lose
ourselves in others. The more we lose ourselves in God the more we
find Him. Men and women love and die. But Love is a Divine Essence
working through and through innumerable lives for its own eternal
glory. Personality is limited only to the finite world&mdash;perhaps a
phase or two beyond the grave. Even that is the sum-total of countless
so-called personalities in the past. We love instinctively. If it
was wholly physical then it dies with the death of the object. If
it was infinitely more than that, if it was the love of Goodness
and Purity and the Beautiful it lives on for ever. But these things
live not eternally in humanity. They are parts of that all-pervading
Essence&mdash;the Love Divine. Love God's light in men and women, and not
the lanterns through which It shines, for human bodies must turn to
dust; human memories, human desires, fade away. But the love of the
All-Good, All-Beautiful remains, and when such is found in earthly love
it is God finding Himself in you, and you in Him. That is the supreme
teaching of Súfíism, the religion of Love.</p>

<h4><a name="I_LIFE" id="I_LIFE">I. LIFE</a></h4>


<p>Jalálu'd-Dín Rúmí was born at Balkh on September 30th, 1207, <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">A.D.</span>,
or according to Mohammedan reckoning, in 604 <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">A.H.</span> His father,
Bahaū-'d-Dín, was a man of much learning, but gave offence to the
reigning king by an attack on that monarch's innovations. Another
account disputes this in the place of jealousy on the part of the king.
Whatever the cause, however, Bahaū-'d-Dín left Balkh, together with
his family, and settled at Nishapur. It was here that the celebrated
Súfí, Farídu'd-Dín 'Attár, presented young Jalálu'd-Dín Rúmí with his
<i>Asrarnama</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_8" id="FNanchor_1_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_8" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and informed his father that the child would some day
become famous throughout the world. After the destruction of Balkh the
family went to Qonia,<a name="FNanchor_2_9" id="FNanchor_2_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_9" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> an old Roman province, where the poet acquired
his name Rúmí, or "the Roman." Young Jalál must have been a child
prodigy if we are to believe the many wonderful stories of his early
days. At six years of age he is said to have seen visions, taught his
playmates philosophy, and performed many marvellous feats, such as
flying into the celestial regions. On the death of his father Jalál
took the professorial chair. He also founded an order of Dervishes
known as Maulavis, where he authorised music and religious dance. When
asked why he introduced singing and dance at a funeral, such practice
being contrary to custom, Jalál replied: "When the human spirit, after
years of imprisonment in the cage and dungeon of the body, is at length
set free, and wings its flight to the Source whence it came, is not
this an occasion for rejoicings, thanks, and dancing?" Jalál was an
indomitable optimist. In his sayings, and still more in his poetry, we
find an almost untrammelled ecstasy. The religious dances, known as
Rizā Kulī, may in some way account for Jalál's occasional lack of care
displayed in his poetry, and also for the outbursts not far removed
from insanity. We are informed by Daulat Sháh that "There was a pillar
in the Maulavi's house, and when he was drowned in the ocean of Love he
used to take hold of that pillar and set himself turning round it." It
was while turning round the pillar that he not infrequently dictated
much of his poetry. As Mr. Arthur Symons has sung:</p>

<p class="poet">
I turn until my sense,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dizzied with waves of air,</span><br />
Spins to a point intense,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And spires and centres there.<a name="FNanchor_3_10" id="FNanchor_3_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_10" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>We can well imagine Jalál writing the following under the conditions
just mentioned:</p>

<p class="poet">
"Come! Come! Thou art the Soul, the Soul so dear, revolving!<br />
Come! Come! Thou art the Cedar, the Cedar's Spear, revolving!<br />
Oh, come! The well of Light up-bubbling springs;<br />
And Morning Stars exult, in Gladness sheer, revolving!"<a name="FNanchor_4_11" id="FNanchor_4_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_11" class="fnanchor">[4]</a><br />
</p>

<p>In 1226 <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">A.D.</span> Jalál was married at Lerenda to Gevher (Pearl). She bore
two sons and died early in life. Jalál married again and his second
wife survived him.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h4><a name="II_SHAMSI_TABRIZ" id="II_SHAMSI_TABRIZ">II. SHAMSI TABRIZ</a></h4>

<p>A word must now be said about Shamsi Tabrīz, an intimate friend of
Jalál. We have sufficient evidence to prove that Shamsi Tabrīz,
Jalál's <i>nom de guerre</i>, was an actual person, and not a mythical
creation on the part of the poet. This mysterious being, who flitted
across Jalál's life so tragically, seems to have had great personal
influence over the poet, who went with him into solitary places and
there discussed profound mysteries. The scholars of Jalál looked upon
the whole affair as an unworthy infatuation on the part of their
Master, and on the part of Shams a shameful seduction. Their protests
brought about the flight of Shams, who fled to Tabrīz. But it was only
a momentary separation. Jalál followed this strange figure and brought
him back again. Most of his lighter poetry was composed during this
separation. Another disturbance, however, caused the departure of Shams
to Damascus. We then have no clear record of him. Various legends exist
in regard to the death of this mysterious person. It may be safely
stated, however, that Shams met with a violent death, the exact nature
of which it is impossible to say definitely.</p>

<p>This strange union is by no means unique in the history of the
world's literature. The union, however, in this particular case, is
extremely difficult to rightly fathom. We may reasonably infer that
Jalál's intense poetic temperament became fascinated by the dogmatic
and powerful Shams. The very treatment of this friendship, both in
the Lyrical Poems, and in the <i>Masnavi</i>, is Súfí The two following
quotations, from many that might be cited, will prove sufficient to
illustrate this point:</p>

<p class="poet">
The face of Shamsi Dín, Tabrīz's glory, is the sun<br />
In whose track the cloud-like hearts are moving.<br />
<br />
O Shamsi Tabrīz, beauty and glory of the horizons,<br />
What king but is a beggar of thee with heart and soul?<br />

<a href="#Footnote_5_12" class="fnanchor" style="font-size:0.7em; font-weight: normal;">[5]</a></h4>


<p>The historian al-Aflākí, in his collection of anecdotes called Menaqibu
'L 'Arifin,<a name="FNanchor_6_13" id="FNanchor_6_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_13" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> gives a number of stories relating to the miracles and
wise sayings of Jalál. Many of these miraculous performances were
followed by the conversion of those who witnessed them. A marvel or
a wise saying of Jalál was generally accompanied by music and dance,
which reminds us of the jubilations of the Indian gods after Rama's
victories over his enemies. These stories, interesting enough in
themselves, can scarcely be credited to such a learned man as Jalál
undoubtedly was. According to tradition he spoke to frogs and fishes,
raised the dead to life, and at the same time very ignominiously lost
his temper when a disciple who said, after having received Jalál's
instructions: "God willing." After all, the significance of Jalál
lies not in these rather lamentable fairy tales, but in the fruit of
his work. Jalál, like the Lord Buddha, suffered considerably from
the addition of fabulous tales and fancies of no real moment to his
teachings.</p>

<p>Al-Aflākí tells a pretty story concerning the tenderness of Jalál for
little children. As the poet passed by some children, they left their
play and ran to him and bowed. Jalál bowed in response. One little boy,
some distance off, seeing the honour bestowed upon his playmates, cried
to Jalál: "Wait for me until I come!" And Jalál waited and bowed to the
little child. This story is worth far more than juggler's tricks.</p>

<p>Jalálu'd-Dín Rúmí died at Qonia in 1273 <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">A.D.</span>, praising God and leaving
to the world a vast store of spiritual knowledge and many wise
instructions to his son, Bahaū-'d-Dín Valad. It is very gratifying to
note that at the death of Jalál his mourners were of all creeds. A
Christian was asked why he wept over a Muslim grave, and he replied:
"We esteem him as the Moses, the David, the Jesus of our time; and
we are his disciples, his adherents." This was indeed a splendid and
worthy tribute to the memory of so great a man.</p>

<p>I hope I have already demonstrated that the very nature of Súfí poetry
is entirely lacking in creed or dogma, and certainly the great singer
of the <i>Masnavi</i> has left in his songs a wealth of the wonder of Divine
Love.</p>

<h4><a name="IV_THE_NATURE_AND_SIGNIFICANCE_OF_JALALUD-DIN_RUMIS_POETRY" id="IV_THE_NATURE_AND_SIGNIFICANCE_OF_JALALUD-DIN_RUMIS_POETRY">IV. THE NATURE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF JALÁLU'D-DÍN RÚMÍ'S POETRY</a></h4>


<p><i>The Lyrical</i>.&mdash;We have already noted the acceptance of the
<i>Asrarnama</i>. Among the other literary influences, according to Mr.
Nicholson, we may note the poems of Sana'ī, Sa'di, and Nīzamī. The
fact that Jalál's poetry sometimes faintly resembles Omar Khayyám's
is too slight to be of any value. Mr. Nicholson very ably sums up
the nature of the <i>Masnavi</i> and <i>Divan</i> respectively: "The one is a
majestic river, calm and deep, meandering through many a rich and
varied landscape to the immeasurable ocean; the other a foaming torrent
that leaps and plunges in the ethereal solitude of the hills." The
poetry of Jalál is not of equal merit. His work seldom if ever has the
technical polish of Jámí. There is too much of it; too much produced
in the belief that all his poetry was inspired. He is fond of harping
on certain words, and as far as the translations are concerned he has
little sense of humour.<a name="FNanchor_7_14" id="FNanchor_7_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_14" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> There was certainly room for a touch of
humour in the poet's description of Iblis receiving from God a gift of
beautiful women whereby to tempt mankind; but Jalál entirely ignores
it. These weaknesses are almost lost in the strength and purity and
lyrical grandeur of many of Jalál's poems. He carries us along on a
torrent of heavenly music. The rhythmic, swing of his wonderful dance
is soul-stirring. We seem to move exultantly, ecstatically, to the
sound of the poet's singing, far behind the silver stars into the
Presence of the Beloved. With what reverence, with what a glow of
simile and subtle suggestion he describes the Beauty of the Beloved!
With what exquisite passion he foretells the Eternal Union! Then
there is a lull in this fierce spiritual song, and Jalál sings, ever
so gently and with an infinite tenderness, about human tears being
turned into "rain-clouds." He sings about the meeting of two friends
in Paradise, with the oft-repeated refrain, "Thou and I." There seems
in this poem an indescribable and almost pathetic play on the idea of
human friendship and the Divine Friendship, a yearning tenderness for
that human shadow, passing shadow though it be. Jalál appears to have
the power of producing almost orchestral effects in his music of the
Spheres. There is that terrific touch of Wagner about his poetry, and
in those suggestive Wagner-pauses there is a tenderness of expression
more touching, more truly great than the loud triumphant notes. Jalál
has truly said: "Our journey is to the Rose-Garden of Union." He sang
about, the Divine Rose-Garden; but he did not forget to sing about the
roses that fade and the human hearts that ache. We seem to see Jalál
ever bowing to the little child in all his wonderful singing.</p>

<p><i>The Masnavi</i>.&mdash;Jalál is said to have been forty-three years engaged
in writing the <i>Masnavi</i>. Often whole nights were spent in its
composition, Jalál reciting and his friend Hasam copying it down and
sometimes singing portions of the verse in his beautiful voice. At the
completion of the first book Hasam's wife died, and two years elapsed
before the work was continued. The <i>Masnavi</i> is full of profound
mysteries, and is a most important book in the study of Súfíism&mdash;
mysteries which must, for the most part, be left to the discernment
of the reader. Jalál himself has said that great Love is silent. It
is in Silence that we shall come to understand the supreme Mystery
of Love that has no comparison. The key-note to the <i>Masnavi</i> may
be found in the Prologue to the first book. The poet here sings of
the soul's longing to be united with the Beloved. The fact that he,
and all other Súfí poets, use as an analogy the love between man and
woman renders the spiritual meaning extremely vague. We have, however,
already considered this point in the introduction, and it needs no
further explanation. The <i>Masnavi</i> has all the pantheistic beauty of
the Psalms, the music of the hills, the colour and scent of roses,
the swaying of forests; but it has considerably more than that. These
things of scent and form and colour are the Mirror of the Beloved;
these earthy loves the journey down the valley into the Rose-Garden
where the roses never fade, and where Love is.</p>

<br />
Yestereve I delivered to a star tidings for thee:<br />
"Present," I said, "my service to that moon-like form."<br />
I bowed, I said: "Bear that service to the sun<br />
Who maketh hard rocks gold by his burning."<br />
I bared my breast, I showed it the wounds:<br />
"Give news of me," I said, "to the Beloved whose drink is blood."<br />
I rocked to and fro that the child, my heart, might become still;<br />
A child sleeps when one sways the cradle.<br />
Give my heart-babe milk, relieve us from its weeping,<br />
O Thou that helpest every moment a hundred helpless like me.<br />
The heart's home, first to last, is Thy City of Union:<br />
How long wilt Thou keep in exile this heart forlorn?<br />

O spirit, make thy head in search and seeking like the water of a stream,<br />
And O reason, to gain Eternal Life tread ever-lastingly the way of Death.<br />
Keep God in remembrance till self is forgotten,<br />
That thou may be lost in the Called, without distraction of caller and call.<br />

Thou who art my soul's comfort in the season of sorrow,<br />
Thou who art my spirit's treasure in the bitterness of dearth!<br />
That which the imagination has not conceived, that which the understanding has not seen,<br />
Visited my soul from Thee; hence in worship I turn toward Thee.<br />
By Thy grace I keep fixed on Eternity my amorous gaze,<br />
Except, O King, the pomps that perish lead me astray.<br />

Even without Thy summons, is sweeter in mine ear than songs.<br />

If a never-ceasing bounty should offer kingdoms,<br />
If a hidden treasure should set before me all that is,<br />
I would bend down my soul, I would lay my face in the dust,<br />
I would say, "Of all these the love of such an One for me!"<br />

<p class="poet3">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">"THOU ART THE SOUL OF THE WORLD"</span><br />
<br />
Eternal Life, methinks, is the time of Union,<br />
Because Time, for me, hath no place There.<br />
Life is the vessels, Union the clear draught in them;<br />
Without Thee what does the pain of the vessels avail me?<br />
I had twenty thousand desires ere this;<br />
In passion for Him not even (care of) my safety remained.<br />
By the help of His grace I am become safe, because<br />
The unseen King saith to me, "Thou art the soul of the world."<br />

<p class="poet3">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">"THE VOICE OF LOVE"</span><br />
<br />
Every moment the voice of Love is coming from left and right.<br />
We are bound for heaven: who has a mind to sight-seeing?<br />
We have been in heaven, we have been friends of the angels;<br />
Thither, Sire, let us return, for that is our country.<br />

<p class="poet3">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE SEA OF LOVE</span><br />
<br />
Mankind, like waterfowl, are sprung from the sea&mdash;the Sea of Soul;<br />
Risen from that Sea, why should the bird make here his home?<br />
Nay, we are pearls in that Sea, therein we all abide;<br />
Else, why does wave follow wave from the Sea of Soul?<br />
'Tis the time of Union's attainment, 'tis the time of Eternity's beauty,<br />
'Tis the time of favour and largesse, 'tis the Ocean of perfect purity.<br />
The billow of largesse hath appeared, the thunder of the Sea hath arrived,<br />
The morn of blessedness hath dawned. Morn? No, 'tis the Light of God.<br />
</p>


<p class="poet3">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE BEAUTY OF THE BELOVED</span><br />
<br />
O Beloved, spiritual beauty is very fair and glorious,<br />
But Thine own beauty and loveliness is another thing.<br />
O Thou who art years describing Spirit,<br />
Show one quality that is equal to His Essence.<br />
Light waxes in the eye at the imagination of Him,<br />
But in presence of His Union it is dimmed.<br />
I stand open-mouthed in veneration of that beauty:<br />
"God is most great" is on my heart's lips every moment.<br />
The heart hath gotten an eye constant in desire of Thee.<br />
O how that desire feeds heart and eye!<br />
'Tis slave-caressing Thy Love has practised;<br />
Else, where is the heart worthy of that Love?<br />
Every heart that has slept one night in Thy air<br />
Is like radiant day.<br />

<p class="poet3">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE WATER OF ETERNAL LIFE</span><br />
<br />
Every form you see has its archetype in the placeless world;<br />
If the form perished, no matter, since its Original is everlasting.<br />
Every fair shape you have seen, every deep saying you have heard,<br />
Be not cast down that it perished; for that is not so.<br />
Whereas the Spring-head is undying, its branch gives water continually;<br />
Since neither can cease, why are you lamenting?<br />
Conceive the Soul as a fountain, and these created things as rivers:<br />
While the Fountain flows, the rivers run from it.<br />
Put grief out of your head and keep quaffing this River-water;<br />
Do not think of the Water failing, for this Water is without end.<br />

'Tis Love and the Lover that live to all Eternity;<br />
Set not thy heart on aught else; 'tis only borrowed,<br />
How long wilt thou embrace a dead beloved?<br />
Embrace the Soul which is embraced by nothing.<br />
What was born of spring dies in autumn,<br />
Love's rose-plot hath no aiding from the early spring.<br />

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">"THE HOUSE OF LOVE"</span><br />
<br />
This is the Lord of Heaven, who resembles Venus and the moon,<br />
This is the House of Love, which has no bound or end.<br />
Like a mirror, the soul has received Thy image in its heart;<br />
The tip of Thy curl has sunk into my heart like a comb.<br />
Forasmuch as the women cut their hands in Joseph's presence,<br />
Come to me, O soul, for the Beloved is in the midst.<br />

O sun, show forth Thy face from the veil of cloud,<br />
For I desire that radiant glowing countenance.<br />

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE FINDING OF THE BELOVED</span><br />
<br />
I was on that day when the Names were not,<br />
Nor any sign of existence endowed with name,<br />
By me Names and Named were brought to view<br />
On the day when there was not "I" and "We,"<br />
For a sign, the tip of the Beloved's curl became a centre of revelation;<br />
As yet the tip of that curl was not.<br />
Cross and Christians, from end to end,<br />
I surveyed; He was not on the Cross.<br />
I went to the idol-temple, to the ancient pagoda;<br />
No trace was visible there.<br />
I went to the mountains of Herāt and Candahār;<br />
I looked; He was not in that hill-and-dale.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">* * * * * * * *¨* * * * * * *</span><br />
I gazed into my own heart;<br />
There I saw Him; He was nowhere else.<br />

<p class="poet3">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE MOON-SOUL AND THE SEA</span><br />
<br />
At morning-tide a moon appeared in the sky,<br />
And descended from the sky and gazed on me.<br />
Like a falcon which snatches a bird at the time of hunting,<br />
That moon snatched me up and coursed over the sky.<br />
When I looked at myself, I saw myself no more,<br />
Because in that moon my body became by grace even as soul.<br />
When I travelled in soul, I saw naught save the moon,<br />
Till the secret of the Eternal Theophany was revealed.<br />
The nine spheres of heaven were all merged in that moon,<br />
The vessel of my being was completely hidden in the sea.<br />
The sea broke into waves, and again Wisdom rose<br />
And cast abroad a voice; so it happened and thus it befell.<br />
Foamed the sea, and at every foam-fleck<br />
Something took figure and something was bodied forth.<br />
Every foam-fleck of body, which received a sign from that sea,<br />
Melted straightway and turned to spirit in this Ocean.<br />

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">LIFE IN DEATH</span><br />
<br />
When my bier moveth on the day of Death,<br />
Think not my heart is in this world.<br />
Do not weep in the devil's snare: that is woe.<br />
When thou seest my hearse, cry not "Parted, parted!"<br />
Union and meeting are mine in that hour.<br />
If thou commit me to the grave, say not "Farewell, farewell!"<br />
For the grave is a curtain hiding the communion of Paradise,<br />
After beholding descent, consider resurrection;<br />
Why should setting be injurious to the sun and moon?<br />
To thee it seems a setting, but 'tis a rising;<br />
Tho' the vault seems a prison, 'tis the release of the soul.<br />

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SELF-AGGRANDISEMENT AND VAINGLORY NO PART OF LOVE</span><br />
<br />
A lover was once admitted to the presence
of his mistress, but, instead of embracing her,
he pulled out a paper of sonnets and read them
to her, describing her perfections and charms
and his own love towards her at length. His
mistress said to him, "You are now in my
presence, and these lovers' sighs and invocations
are a waste of time. It is not the part of a true
lover to waste his time in this way. It shows that
I am not the real object of your affection, but
that what you really love is your own effusions
and ecstatic raptures. I see, as it were, the water
which I have longed for before me, and yet you
withhold it. I am, as it were, in Bulgaria, and
the object of your love is in Cathay. One who
is really loved is the single object of her lover,
the Alpha and Omega of his desires. As for
you, you are wrapped up in your own amorous
raptures, depending on the varying states of
your own feelings, instead of being wrapped
up in me."</p>


<p class="block">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">"I AM THINE, AND THOU ART MINE!"</span><br />
<br />
Eternal Life is gained by utter abandonment
of one's own life. When God appears to His
ardent lover the lover is absorbed in Him, and
not so much as a hair of the lover remains.
True lovers are as shadows, and when the sun
shines in glory the shadows vanish away. He
is a true lover to God to whom God says, "I am
thine, and thou art Mine!"</p>


<p class="block">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">LOVE NEEDS NO MEDIATOR</span><br />
<br />
When one has attained Union with God he
has no need of intermediaries. Prophets and
apostles are needed as links to connect ordinary
man with God, but he who hears the "inner
voice" within him has no need to listen to
outward words, even of apostles. Although that
intercession is himself dwelling in God, yet my
state is higher and more lovely than his. Though
he is God's agent, yet I desire not his intercession
to save me from evil sent me by God, for evil
at God's hand seems to me good. What seems
mercy and kindness to the vulgar seems wrath
and vengeance to God-intoxicated saints.</p>


<p class="block">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HUMANITY THE REFLECTION OF THE BELOVED</span><br />
<br />
Parrots are taught to speak without understanding
the words. The method is to place a mirror
between the parrot and the trainer. The trainer,
hidden by the mirror, utters the words, and the
parrot, seeing his own reflection in the mirror,
fancies another parrot is speaking, and imitates
all that is said by the trainer behind the mirror.
So God uses prophets and saints as mirrors
whereby to instruct men, viz., the bodies of
these saints and prophets; and men, when they
hear the words proceeding from these mirrors,
are utterly ignorant that they are really being
spoken by "Universal Reason" or the "Word
of God" behind the mirror of the saints.</p>

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">"EARTHLY FORMS"</span><br />

<p class="block">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">"THE BEATIFIC VISION OF ETERNAL TRUTH"</span><br />
<br />
The end and object of all negation is to attain
to subsequent affirmation, as the negation in
the creed, "There is no God," finds its complement
and purpose in the affirmation "but
God." Just so the purpose of negation of self
is to clear the way for the apprehension of the
fact that there is no existence but the One.
The intoxication of Life and its pleasures and
occupations veils the Truth from men's eyes,
and they ought to pass on to the spiritual intoxication
which makes men beside themselves
and lifts them to the beatific vision of eternal
Truth.</p>

Your ears, now worthless as wool, will become gems;<br />
Yea, your whole body will become a mirror,<br />
It will be as an eye of a bright gem in your bosom.<br />
First the hearing of the ear enables you to form ideas,<br />
Then these ideas guide you to the Beloved.<br />
Strive, then, to increase the number of these ideas,<br />
That they may guide you, like Majnun, to the Beloved.<br />

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">"THERE IS A PLACE OF REFUGE"</span><br />
<br />
Yea, O sleeping heart, know the kingdom that endures not<br />
For ever and ever is only a mere dream.<br />
I marvel how long you will indulge in vain illusion,<br />
Which has seized you by the throat like a heads man.<br />
Know that even in this world there is a place of refuge;<br />
Hearken not to the unbeliever who denies it.<br />
His argument is this: he says again and again,<br />
"If there were aught beyond this life we should see it."<br />
But if the child see not the state of reason,<br />
Does the man of reason therefore forsake reason?<br />
And if the man of reason sees not the state of Love,<br />
Is the blessed moon of Love thereby eclipsed?<br />

The palm of Thy hand on my head gives me rest,<br />
Thy hand is a sign of Thy bounteous providence.<br />

He takes a few drops of your tears,<br />

He takes your sighs fraught with grief and sadness,<br />

When the fowler sounds his decoy whistle,<br />

So vile hypocrites steal the language of Dervishes,<br />

therein, and upon one of these mansions she read
her own name inscribed. And a voice from
heaven informed her that God would accept
the sorrows she had endured in lieu of her blood
shed in holy war, as, owing to her sex, she was
unable to go out to battle like the men. On
looking again, the woman beheld in Paradise
all the children she had lost, and she cried, "O
Lord! they were lost to me, but safe with Thee!"</p>

<h4>NĪZAMĪ'S DISCOURSE ON POETRY</h4>


<p>In Nīzamī's <i>The Chahár Magála</i> ("Four Discourses"),
translated by Professor Edward G.
Browne, we find the <i>Second Discourse</i> devoted
to "The Nature of Poetry, and the Utility of the
Skilful Poet." In this interesting Discourse
Nīzamī very amiably discusses the training
required to become a poet of enduring fame, and
intersperses these remarks with a number of
anecdotes, which in the main are examples of the
advantages derived from poetic improvisations
given at opportune moments before kings when
wine has gone round two or three times. Nīzamī
sums up the nature of poetry in the following
words: "Poetry is that art whereby the poet
arranges imaginary propositions and adapts the
deductions, with the result that he can make a
little thing appear great and a great thing small,
or cause good to appear in the garb of evil and
evil in the garb of good." Nīzamī denounces
the habit of giving money to old poets. He
remarks: "For one so ignoble as not to have
discovered in fifty years that what he writes is
bad, when will he discover it?" On the other
hand Nīzamī favours the young poet with hopeful
talent, and generously remarks that "it is proper
to patronise him, a duty to take care of him, and
an obligation to maintain him." The minor
poets of to-day have not these glowing advantages!</p>

<p>The most ingenious example of a poetic improvisation
in this <i>Discourse</i> is, perhaps, one
given by Rúdagí in connection with the protracted
stay of Amír Nasr b. Ahmad in Herát.
Four years the Amír camped with his army in
this town, with its twenty different varieties of
grape and beautiful narcissus. "He preferred
Herát to the Garden of Eden." But at length
the Amír's captains and courtiers grew weary of
being absent so long from Bukhárá, where they
longed to see their wives and children again.
They offered Rúdagí, the poet, five thousand
dinars if he could persuade the Amír to quit
Herát and return to Bukhárá. Rúdagí, at an
opportune moment, took up his harp and sang
the following song to the Amír:</p>

<p class="poet">
The sands of Oxus, toilsome though they be,<br />
Beneath my feet were soft as silk to me.<br />
Glad at the friend's return, the Oxus deep<br />
Up to our girths in laughing waves shall leap.<br />
Long live Bukhárá! Be thou of good cheer!<br />
Joyous towards thee hasteth our Amír!<br />
The Moon's the Prince, Bukhárá, is the sky;<br />
O sky, the Moon shall light thee by and bye!<br />
Bukhárá, is the mead, the Cypress he;<br />
Receive at last, O Mead, thy Cypress-tree!<br />
</p>

<p>This particular Amír seems to have been fond of
flattery, and he found the daintily turned song
of Rúdagí more acceptable to his vanity than
even the beauty of Herát. He accordingly took
his departure immediately the song had concluded,
and, in his absent-mindedness, forgot to
put on his boots, which were carried by an
attendant who rode in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>Poetry in those days was evidently a remunerative
pursuit. Nīzamī tells us that Khidr Khán
always had in readiness four trays of gold.
"These he used to dispense by the handful" to
the successful poets. Though the royal favour
towards the poets was extremely bountiful,
Persian poets were not always particularly
courteous the one to the other. Nīzamī tells
an amusing story of a minor poet named Rashídí.
At the king's command the Poet-Laureate was
asked to express his opinion of Rashídí's poetry.
The Poet-Laureate accordingly remarked: "His
verse is extremely good and chaste and correct,
but it wants spice." The king afterwards repeated
these words to Rashídí and bade him
compose a fitting rejoinder. Rashídí composed
the following verse:</p>

<p class="poet">
You stigmatise my verse as "wanting spice,"<br />
And possibly, my friend, you may be right.<br />
My verse is honey-flavoured, sugar-sweet,<br />
And spice with such could scarcely cause delight.<br />
Spice is for you, you blackguard, not for me,<br />
For beans and turnips is the stuff you write!<br />
</p>

<p>This was not kind; but Rashídí received all
four baskets of gold that day!</p>

<p>The technical study of prosody was instituted
by Khalil ibn i Ahmad i Bicrí. He is said to
have discovered this science by listening to the
rythmic beats of the fuller's mallets upon his
clothes. This story is mentioned in Saifi's
<i>Treatise on Prosody</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1_25" id="FNanchor_1_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_25" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Much of Persian poetry is conventional, and
the demarcation in style, due to the various
phases of Persian history, is not as pronounced
as might be expected. The Persian poets not
only conservatively followed old metres, but old
similes, old subjects as well. It was with words
they were most concerned, and not with ideas.
The <i>Lover's Companion</i> of Sharafu'd-Dín
Rámí is sufficient to prove this. The book
contains a very large number of similes on the
various parts of the body. This was intended to
be a <i>vade mecum</i> to the writer of erotic poetry.
Professor Brown defends this conservatism and
remarks that it has "guarded the Persian
language from the vulgarisation which the
triumph of an untrained, untrammelled, and
unconventional genius of the barbaric-degenerate
type tends to produce in our own and other
European tongues."</p>
